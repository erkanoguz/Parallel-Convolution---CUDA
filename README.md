# Parallel-Convolution---CUDA
 Separable image convolution using CUDA
 
 
Convolutions are used by many application for engineering. In this project CUDA is used for an efficient and high performance implementation ofseparable convolutoion filter. All code is developed with pencv 4.1.0 and CUDA 10.1 libraries on Visiual Studio 2019 platform. 
Sequential convolution is performed on CPU and Parallel convolution is performed on GPU using global memory

**CONVOLUTION**

In mathematically, Convolution is a mathematical way of combining two signals to form a third signal.
